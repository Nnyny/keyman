* New Features:
  * Began adding support for our common LMLayer interface for predictive modeling.
    * Implemented WebWorker background thread for the heavy lifting; all API calls with relevant return values return Promises.
    * Provides API for the following language-modeling functions:
      * predict - Prediction of user's desired word based on context and recent input
        * Also returns a tagged prediction corresponding to the original context state.
        * Corrections are currently limited to the most recent input keystroke.
        * Accepts a probability distribution for the most recent keystroke, which is be used to weight prediction probabilities
      * wordbreak - Performs wordbreaking on the current context state
        * A default wordbreaker based on the Unicode specification is provided as a default.
    * Implements a common "template" for weighted wordlist lexical model functionality:
      * Accepts a "search term to key" function to facilitate common corrections, such as diacritics,
      during prediction lookups.
      * Predictions are weighted based on their frequency and their input likelihood (based on keystroke probabilities).
    * Accepts fully-specified custom lexical models that do not rely on model "templates."

* Changes:
  * Resumed TypeScript conversion work, resulting in significant internal restructuring and reorganization while leaving our published API intact.
    * Mobile web "touch alias" elements have been refactored into their own type.
    * Heavily reorganizes and refactors the keystroke processing engine of KMW.
      * Attachment to all supported element types has now been abstracted, splitting keystroke processing from related DOM management.
      * Centralizes code paths to improve parity between hardware and OSK-based keystrokes.
    * In both cases above, significant unit testing was facilitated and has been added as a result, further improving code maintainability into the future.
